# CS 312_BoothLink

## Description
BoothLink is a web-based application that allows non-students and students of Saint Louis University (SLU) to make reservations for items and services sold by SLU organizations within the campuses during events. The application demands that each booth be associated with a pre-existing organization within the campus and does not accept any attempts to put up a stall otherwise. Each organization is permitted to have several stalls. Furthermore, multiple vendor accounts can be created and associated with one or more organizations.
